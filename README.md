### Hi there! 👋🏻
I currently studying <b>Full Stack Web Development</b> at <a href="https://www.betrybe.com/">Trybe</a> School. Based in Minas Gerais, Brazil, I'm a 22-year-old tech enthusiast guy who's equally passionate about 80's music, fiction books and good movies. Creativity is one of my strongest points. Before entering, and falling in love with, the dev world, I worked as a designer and filmmaker. These experiences contributed to the fact that today I have a very critical aesthetic view of my work as a developer.
